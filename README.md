# CS5600: Final Project

## Turning ELIZA into a Fedora Linux tech support agent

The idea for this project is to turn ELIZA from a therapist to a tech support agent (which actually isn't far off from a therapist). My version of ELIZA will focus on helping a user with the basics of navigating Fedora 38 using the GNOME desktop environment.

This version of ELIZA will help with the following issues a user might have:
 - Connecting to the internet
 - Connecting to a printer
 - Updating the system
 - Creating multiple users
 - Taking photos with the webcam
 - Playing video games on Fedora
 - Preventing crashes
 - installing new packages
 - removing packages
 - installing python
 - Changing system settings
   - Desktop wallpaper, sound device, changing default monitor, changing to dark theme
